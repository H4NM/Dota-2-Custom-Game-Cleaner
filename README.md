# Dota-2-Custom-Game-Cleaner
Simple script for clearing out unwanted Dota 2 custom games. You may either manually delete the games via the application itself, but this is much faster and can be run whenever after testing out different custom games.

## Details
This script uses the modules os and re for iterating through all of the local custom game files and reviewing its description. The only input required by the user is to specify which custom games they want to keep and the path to the directory of which the custom games are located.
